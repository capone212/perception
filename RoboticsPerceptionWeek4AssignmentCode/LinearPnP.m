function [C, R] = LinearPnP(X, x, K)
%% LinearPnP
% Getting pose from 2D-3D correspondences
% Inputs:
%     X - size (N x 3) matrix of 3D points
%     x - size (N x 2) matrix of 2D points whose rows correspond with X
%     K - size (3 x 3) camera calibration (intrinsics) matrix
% Outputs:
%     C - size (3 x 1) pose transation
%     R - size (3 x 1) pose rotation
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE: While theoretically you can use the x directly when solving
% for the P = [R t] matrix then use the K matrix to correct the error, this is
% more numeically unstable, and thus it is better to calibrate the x values
% before the computation of P then extract R and t directly
